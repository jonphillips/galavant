# Backlog — granular enhancements

Not milestone-scoped (see ROADMAP.md for those). Running list of refinements
noted in passing, with enough context to act on cold.

## Capture form should be search-first and auto-populated (from Jon, 2026-06-12)

The New Idea form currently leads with Name, then a Location section midway
down. It should **invert**: location search at the *top*, driving the form. You
search a place, pick it, and the rest fills in from what MapKit returns:

- **Kind** ← `MKMapItem.pointOfInterestCategory` mapped to `IdeaKind`
  (e.g. `.restaurant` → `.food`, `.museum` → `.museum`, `.hotel` → `.stay`).
  Build the category→kind table; fall back to unspecified.
- **Link** ← `MKMapItem.url` (the place's website).
- **Address / phone** ← `MKMapItem.placemark` / `phoneNumber` (we currently
  only keep locality as `regionName`; capture more).
- Name is already auto-filled; the rest of the form becomes confirm-and-tweak.

This is the on-device cousin of the V1 server enrichment (scraping-enrichment.md)
— MKMapItem is itself a rich enrichment source we're underusing. Pull forward
into M2 capture polish or fold into M4.

## Location search robustness (from Jon, 2026-06-12)

"Noma Copenhagen" returned no results, while "Tivoli Gardens" worked.
Hypothesis: a combined `"<name> <city>"` query underperforms in
`MKLocalSearchCompleter` versus searching `"<name>"` with a **region bias**
(set `completer.region` to the area of interest). Investigate: bias the
completer by the user's current map region (or last-used region), and/or split
trailing city tokens. Also confirm `resultTypes`/`pointOfInterestFilter` aren't
over-narrowing.

## Filter reminder above the list (from Jon, 2026-06-12) — DONE

Show active filter settings in small text above the filtered list. Implemented
2026-06-12 (filter summary bar via `safeAreaInset`).
